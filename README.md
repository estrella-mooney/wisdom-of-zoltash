# wisdom-of-zoltash

// PROJECT: THE WISDOM OF ZOLTASH

//  Page description: step right up, and prepare to be dazzled by these super accurate fortune telling feats. The page will ask you a question, then populate to another
// page asking for a different question. Then a third one. Finally, you will be given the answers you've sought for so long.

// Ideas for questions:

// - Favourite number? [free text]
// - Favourite colour? [drop down..?]
// - What is a lyric from a song you like? The town you were born? If you could tell your younger self one piece of advice, what would it be? [etc, something a bit more open]

// The final page will give you a (partially random) response from a database of three responses, but where some personlization has been made and modifications done based on user input.

// Learning competencies this will use:

// - Displaying pages using handlebars
// - capturing user input, then modifying pre-existing data to encapsulate this (like in Pupperazzi section 4 'updating a puppy')

// TO DOs (in no particular order, as I think of them):

// [ ] index.js file:

- set up PORT / server

// [ ] server.js file

- 

// [ ] handlebars files to set up layouts
// [ ] main.css file
// [ ] index.js file
// [ ] data.json
// [ ] gitignore file....?
// [ ] make some tests! test file (if we have time)
